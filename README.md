## impostor: A Google Chrome extension to impersonate others.
* I want my friend to use my ChatGPT account but I do not have a password (I use OAuth2) to share, so I made this extension to share my openai account's access tokens in the cookies.  
* Mechanism
  1. Get cookies that matches a specified domain (openai.com).
  2. Export the cookies as text.
  3. Import the cookies from text on another machine.
## To-do list
* More filters: Should be about to match cookies by url, path, etc.
